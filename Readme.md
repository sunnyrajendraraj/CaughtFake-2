##  Overview

This project presents an advanced approach to **Deepfake Detection** by integrating **temporal modeling** using **optical flow** and **facial movement analysis over time**. It is designed to identify subtle temporal inconsistencies across video frames, which are often overlooked by traditional deepfake detectors that focus solely on spatial features.

It builds upon previous work ([DeepFakeDetection_-DFDC-](https://github.com/SAARKS-BH/DeepFakeDetection_-DFDC-)), enhancing detection performance through dynamic facial behavior modeling.

##  Why This Project Matters

With the rise of generative AI, deepfakes are increasingly realistic and harder to catch using static image-based models. This has serious implications for:

-  Media authenticity  
-  Political misinformation  
-  Legal evidence validation  
-  Identity fraud and impersonation

This model analyzes **facial motion over time**, adding a crucial dimension to improve detection accuracy â€” **temporal coherence**.

##  Objective

To develop a deepfake detection prototype that:
- Uses **optical flow** to extract motion vectors between frames
- Models **temporal dependencies** in facial expressions and movements
- Outperforms static-only CNN-based methods

---

##  Key Features

-  **Optical Flow Integration**: Captures inter-frame motion, highlighting unnatural facial transitions.
-  **Temporal Attention Modeling**: Detects inconsistencies in eye movements, blinking, lip synchronization, etc.
-  **Visual Output Support**: Generates annotated `.png` files to highlight temporal anomalies.
-  **Modular Jupyter Notebook Workflow**: Easy to modify, interpret, and retrain.

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Frames are extracted from videos and converted to grayscale.
- Optical flow (Farneback method) is used to calculate frame-to-frame motion.
- Each video is converted into a temporal sequence of flow maps.

### 2. Model Architecture
- Input: Sequences of optical flow frames
- Components:
  - `TimeDistributed` Conv2D layers â†’ spatial feature extractor
  - LSTM â†’ models sequential dependencies in facial movements
  - Dense layer â†’ binary classification (Real vs Fake)

### 3. Training & Evaluation
- Loss function: Binary Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy and loss on validation/test splits
- Includes **early stopping** to prevent overfitting

##  Industry Potential

This detection system is highly applicable to:

-  **Forensics** â€“ Authenticity checks in legal scenarios
-  **Social Media Platforms** â€“ Flagging synthetic videos in real-time
-  **News Agencies** â€“ Validating citizen journalism footage
-  **Digital KYC & Banking** â€“ Preventing facial identity fraud

Temporal modeling exposes inconsistencies in facial dynamics â€” a weakness still found in even the best AI-generated fakes.
